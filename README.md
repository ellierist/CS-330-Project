# CS-330-Project
How do I approach designing software?
Designing software requires knowing the requirements necessary for the program. I usually start with listing out what requirements are needed. From there I can see what functions are needed. Then I can see what variables are necessary for the functions. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The work on this project has helped me develop new design skills such as focusing on the overall look of the design. The details are important, but ensuring that your scene is cohesive is extremely important. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed for this project was choosing a picture to base my work off of. Once the objects and location were chosen, the objects were placed. This initial design would guide the rest of the project as the program had to look similar to this initial photo, especially focusing on the correct placement. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Having a solid base design approach can set you up for success in the beginning. This is beneficial for all projects as a good base is needed. 

How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I usually start designing first. Then I choose what functions this program will need. Then I need to decide on the variables necessary for the functions. Once this is completed, I start programming based on the previous information. If I find that there are areas that need improvement, I go back and redesign the area that needs improvement. As I go through this process, I test as I go to ensure the program is running as it should.  

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene included  focusing on reusability and longevity. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was extremely important during development. Being able to create multiple objects with the same code made the program extremely versatile. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Each week we needed to complete another step of our project. Each week I had to readjust my code to ensure I was meeting that weeks assignment requirements. A few times I felt like my code was not efficient and so I had to go back and restart during some weeks, but overall the project benefited from these revisions.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is crucial in helping me reach my goal of becoming a software engineer. Computer science teaches the skills and theories needed as a software engineer. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations allowed me to learn a new more about a topic that I had no previous knowledge on. The knowledge learned helped me refine C++ skills while also teaching me brand new topics. These skills will help me with my future educatation as this course helped me stay organized and on top of learning these new skills. Learning new skills quickly is important for education. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
 As a software engineer it is crucial to be able to pick up on new skills quickly as we often need to learn programming languages that we have never used before. This course required us to learn very quickly, which shows how capable we are of picking up on new things quickly and successfully.
